# Emacs configuration

A fresh start, using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).

To keep things organized, I store setting files under `config/` and load them
from the top-level `config.el` file.

I will try to gradually port the good parts of [my previous
configuration](https://github.com/Guillawme/emacs.d).
